# Data-Science-Final-Bouldering

In this final project for my Data Science course, I leveraged my skills in Python, matplotlib, model training, and deployment to analyze climbing data from multiple sources. The goal was to determine which features of strength and body composition were most relevant when observing a person's max boulder.

To accomplish this, I first conducted exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to identify key variables. Next, I used Python to train a machine learning model to predict a person's approximate Hardest V grade based on various body and strength metrics.

To make the project more accessible and interactive, I deployed the model using a Streamlit dashboard. This allowed users to input their own metrics and receive a personalized prediction for their Hardest V grade achievable.

Overall, this project allowed me to showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and deployment, while also exploring my passion for climbing and bouldering.
