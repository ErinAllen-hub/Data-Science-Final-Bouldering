# Data-Science-Final-Bouldering
This is my final project for my Data Science course. I analyzed climbing data from multiple sources to determine what features of strength and body composition were most relevant when observing a persons max boulder. 

I also made a prediction model and using a Streamlit dashboard, can determine a persons approximate Hardest V grade achievable base don various body and strength metrics.

Thank you for looking at my project :)
